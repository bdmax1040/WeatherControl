# Weather Control Datapack

This is a datapack which allows ANY player to have control over the weather, regardless of if they have op permissions, by using the `/trigger` command.

 - `/trigger clear` - Sets weather to clear
 - `/trigger rain` - Sets weather to rain
 - `/trigger thunder` - Sets weather to thunder storm

On data pack load, the gamerule 'doWeatherCycle' is disabled.
